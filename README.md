# HiddenApps
Main use of this should be on linux, since 99% of them don't have a system tray.

For example: Discord has an active window you can click "exit" on it, but it will still stay open, and if you are in a call and you hit "exit", you won't actually leave the call, just hide the window. This script will give you the ability to check for it and shut discord down properly.
